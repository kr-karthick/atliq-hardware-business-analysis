## MySQL Course Completion - Project Overview 🚀


## 📌 Project Overview: AtliQ Hardware

This repository showcases projects and exercises completed during the MySQL course by Codebasics. It highlights practical applications of MySQL for data analysis, database design, and query optimization. 

## 📜 Business Context

AtliQ Hardware is a global computer hardware firm selling products across multiple channels like distributors, direct sales, and retailers (Brick & Mortar, E-commerce).

🔍 Key Highlights:

✨Analyzed the differences between Relational and Non-Relational Databases to determine optimal use cases.
✨Modeled a Profit & Loss Analysis (P&L) framework for financial insights.
✨Built database structures with Fact and Dimension Tables using Star and Snowflake Schemas.
✨Implemented User-Defined Functions to calculate fiscal year and fiscal quarter (get_fiscal_year, get_fiscal_quarter).
✨Applied Kanban Methodology via Jira for Agile project management.


💡 Key Skills and Concepts Acquired

✨ SQL Proficiency:
Mastered fundamental and advanced SQL concepts, including SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS).

🔄 Advanced SQL Techniques:
Developed skills in Subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Views, Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK), and Temporary Tables.

📊 Database Design:
Designed normalized relational database schemas (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) with primary and foreign keys. Implemented constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and intelligent indexing for enhanced performance.

⚡ Optimization Strategies:
Optimized query performance using indexing, partitioning, execution plans, and query restructuring.

🔧 ETL Fundamentals:
Understood OLTP vs. OLAP concepts and explored Data Warehouse architecture.

🛠️ Development Techniques:
Implemented User-Defined Functions, Stored Procedures, Indexes, Triggers, and Events for dynamic database management.


🛠 Tools and Technologies:
